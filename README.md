# Git DUO - Never Lose Access to Your Repositories Again

<p id="intro">Git DUO is a tool designed to automate the process of mirroring Git repositories across multiple platforms. Born out of a traumatic experience where my GitHub account was temporarily limited during a server disruption, Git DUO ensures that your hard work is never at the mercy of a single service provider. By mirroring your repositories on both GitHub and GitLab, Git DUO protects your years of effort and guarantees continuous access to your public work.</p>

## Installation - Step-by-Step Guide ü™ú

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Node.js**: Git DUO is a Node.js application. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**:

   - Generate a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub. This token is required to authenticate with the GitHub API.
   - **Scope of PAT** - Requires `repo` scope.
   - Store this token in an environment variable named `github_token`.
   - [How to create a GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

3. **GitLab Personal Access Token**:

   - Generate a personal access token from GitLab. This token is required to authenticate with the GitLab API.
   - **Scope of PAT** - Requires `api` scope with `read & write` permission.
   - Store this token in an environment variable named `gitlab_token`.
   - [How to create a GitLab PAT](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

   **Note**: The environment variables need to be set manually in your operating system, as the application does not support `.env` files.

4. **Install via npm**:

   - To install Git DUO globally using npm, run the following command:
     ```bash
     npm install -g git-duo
     ```
   - This will make the Git DUO CLI commands available system-wide.

5. **Set Up the Git Template**:

   - To set up the Git template for automatic mirroring, use the following command:
     ```bash
     gdt [destination-path]
     ```
   - If no destination path is provided, the template will be added to the default user directory.

   - **How It Works**: Once the template is set up, every time you commit changes to a repository, the changes are automatically pushed to the secondary remote (GitLab) by a `post-commit` hook. The primary repository (GitHub) is pushed by the user.

## Usage

- **Create a New Repository on Both Platforms**:

  - Use the following command to create a new repository on both GitHub and GitLab:
    ```bash
    gd <repository-name> --private
    ```
  - The `--private` flag is optional and will make the repository private if included.

- **Recommended Workflow**:
  - **If using VS Code**: Simply commit and push as you normally would in the VS Code interface. The changes will be pushed to GitHub by your action and to GitLab by the post-commit hook.
  - **If using the CLI**: You can commit and push using the following command:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "message" && git push
    ```
  - By doing so, both the primary (GitHub) and secondary (GitLab) repositories will be updated‚ÄîGitHub by your push command and GitLab by the commit hook.
